%p Welcome to the Department of Computer Science's Job Board! If you are interested in recruiting undergraduates, masters students, and PhD students in the Department of Computer Science, we encourage you to submit job postings to this job board.

%p Please note that this job board is distinct from the (university-wide) Chicago Career Connections (CCC) site run by the Career Advancement office. Unlike the CCC site, our job board does not require students to create an account or submit a resum√© before they can view job postings. Although this precludes doing in-depth tracking of job applicants, we find it is much more effective at getting the word out quickly about open positions (all positions submitted to the CS job board are publicly viewable). However, both sites are not mutually exclusive (in fact our job board is meant to complement CCC). If you prefer that students apply through CCC, please feel free to indicate so in the job posting. Nonetheless, we strongly encourage you to always provide an alternate application method: many of the Computer Science students do not have accounts on CCC, and may be discouraged from applying with your company if the only way to apply is through CCC.

%p The process to submit a job posting is simple:

                A 2-3 paragraph description of the position. Please make sure to include a list of requirements for the position (languages, skills, etc.). You should also include specific instructions on how students can apply for this job. As noted above, if you would like students to apply through CCC, we strongly encourage you to list an additional application method for students who don't have CCC accounts.

                You can specify a few short tags that describe the position (e.g., you could enter tag "Java" for a job that requires Java skills). This information is used by students to search for jobs matching their interests.

            %li 
                %strong Approved:

            %li 
                %strong Rejected:
                Your job posting was rejected. The administrator will include a note explaining why. This is generally only done when we suspect a posting to be spam, and not a legitimate job posting.

    %li After your posting is approved, you can make changes to it (e.g., you can update the description, or extend the deadline). However, please note that changes will have to be reviewed by our administrators. While the updated posting is being reviewed, it will not be visible on the job board.
